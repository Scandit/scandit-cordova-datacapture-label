 *
 * - **Content analysis** of texts and barcodes for validation
 * - **Barcode symbology** detection for field identification
 * - **Relative field positioning** within the label layout
 * - **Textual context** to understand field relationships
 *

 * - **Smart device label scanning** for IMEI and serial numbers
 * - **Shelf price label verification** for retail operations
 * - **Vehicle identification number (VIN) capture** from automotive labels
 *

 *
 * The key components of Label Capture are:
 *
 * - **Label Definitions**: Define the structure and expected fields of labels
 * - **Field Definitions**: - Define individual data fields (barcodes, text, dates, etc.)
 * - **Captured Labels**: - Represent successfully scanned labels with all their field data
 *
 * Label Capture can track labels across multiple frames, allowing for progressive scanning where fields are captured over time until the complete label is assembled.

/**
 * Smart Label Capture enables simultaneous scanning of multiple barcodes and printed text on labels, streamlining data entry and reducing errors. This data capture mode combines barcode recognition with OCR to extract contextually relevant data fields from labels with structured layouts.
 *
 * Smart Label Capture intelligently identifies label information using multiple recognition approaches:
 *
 * - **Content analysis** of texts and barcodes for validation
 * - **Barcode symbology** detection for field identification
 * - **Relative field positioning** within the label layout
 * - **Textual context** to understand field relationships
 *
 * Primary use cases include:
 *
 * - **Retail product scanning** with price verification
 * - **Smart device label scanning** for IMEI and serial numbers
 * - **Shelf price label verification** for retail operations
 * - **Vehicle identification number (VIN) capture** from automotive labels
 *
 * Unlike {@link BarcodeCapture} which focuses on individual barcodes, Smart Label Capture provides contextual intelligence to extract multiple data types simultaneously and supports flexible field definitions for diverse label layouts.
 *
 * The key components of Label Capture are:
 *
 * - **Label Definitions**: Define the structure and expected fields of labels
 * - **Field Definitions**: - Define individual data fields (barcodes, text, dates, etc.)
 * - **Captured Labels**: - Represent successfully scanned labels with all their field data
 *
 * Label Capture can track labels across multiple frames, allowing for progressive scanning where fields are captured over time until the complete label is assembled.
 *
 * It cannot be used together with other capture modes that require the same capabilities, e.g. {@link BarcodeCapture} or {@link BarcodeBatch}.

 *
 * - **Multi-step scanning** - Capture several label fields across multiple scans
 * - **Field-by-field validation** - Validate individual fields as they are captured
 * - **User review interface** - Allow users to review and correct captured data
 * - **Configurable hint messages** - Guide users through different scanning stages
 * - **Manual input support** - Enable manual entry for fields that cannot be scanned
 *
 * The validation flow ensures complete and accurate results by aggregating captured fields into a complete label which is reported through the {@link LabelCaptureValidationFlowListener}.
 *
 * This overlay focuses on validation flow and does not provide barcode or field highlighting. For visual feedback during scanning, use {@link LabelCaptureBasicOverlay} alongside this overlay.
 *
 * The validation flow overlay only works with a single label definition. This label definition can contain multiple barcodes, text fields, expiry dates, and other field types.
